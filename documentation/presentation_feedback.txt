Get away with using no words if possible - talk more than whats on the slides



INCLUDE THIS SLIDE
I am a coach, how do I benefit from this
Make the importance of the work clear:
	How does the work help in day to day operations for a football manager, tactician, owner?
	Motivate the project at the very beginning (slide 2)

hardest part: relating numbers back to the actual game. figure this out
Maybe have appendix slide for q&a


GOALS
Bring back these questions - how would they help a coach/tacticians? Make this connection very clear



UNSUPERVISED CLUSTERING (can get rid of this if needed)

GRAPHS (FOCUS ON 4/5 features, or highlight the important features, say with a red box)
	try putting video highlights around which ones are significantly different

 
PUT THE MOST TIME TO CASE STUDY 1 vs 3
	go back to the initial scenario - use it to do a side by side comparison -> they are significantly different
	so it lead to them being classified differently

	Goal was to identify playing style: couple of words to summarize each cluster. What's 
	characteristic of each cluster?

super cool if I describe say real vs atletico in different clusters, then have a clip to show exactly what I mean
