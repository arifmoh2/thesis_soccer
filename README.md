This is code for my Engineering Science Machine Intelligence Thesis Project. The project is regarding sports analytics in soccer games, and it was supervised by Professor Timothy Chan at the University of Toronto.
The final thesis document can be found in [in the documentation](/documentation/Defining%20Soccer%20Playing%20Styles%20through%20a%20Data-Driven%20Approach.pdf)

To recreate the results, start from the raw data [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f1G667FhHugzHGzqa3k2pWWqbp72WAik?usp=sharing), set the root directory to this folder, and begin running the notebooks chronologically, as numbered.
